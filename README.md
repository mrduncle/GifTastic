# GifTastic
A gif project to showcase some of the greatest natural beauty in the world.

Type in the name of a river or waterfall of your choice and then click on its button to search the giphy api for matches.
Some of the matches are a bit dodge because giphy is too lacking in varie-tay as it sticks to mainstream topics like cuddly animals
and other such banality

* Click on one of the pictures to see it animate
* Click it again to stop animation or click on a new picture to cease animation of the current and start animation on the new
* Some animations take a little while to activate so be patient
